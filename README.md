# IndivdualGithubExercise-cosc499
This is a repo to demonstrate we know how github works and below is the documentation of what I did.

- first I simply created a repo and then cloned it using git bash.
- then I created two branches, one being intBig and the other stringBig. I then pushed them to the remote repo.
- I then started working on the intBig branch (created a java file that picks the bigger number of two ints.
- I then pushed my commits to bigInt, then merged it to main using a pull request, then did another pull request to stringBig to make sure I had everything 
  before starting.
- I then commited to stringBig, then pulled the new changes to main
- Lastly I added testing, and comments
